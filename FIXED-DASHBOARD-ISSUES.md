# Dashboard Issues Resolution

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing CSS and JS Asset Files

Fixed by updating the Vite configuration to properly include all necessary assets and build them correctly.

### 2. Alpine.js Error (`$store.sidebar.isOpen` undefined)

Fixed by enhancing the `filament-init.js` file to properly initialize Alpine.js stores:

- Added `sidebar` store with proper state management
- Added additional Filament stores for theme and notifications
- Ensured stores are initialized on page load

### 3. Alpine.js Error (`$store.sidebar.groupIsCollapsed` and `$store.sidebar.toggleCollapsedGroup` is not a function)

Fixed by updating the sidebar store in `filament-init.js` file to add missing methods:

- Added `collapsedGroups` property to store the state of each navigation group
- Implemented `groupIsCollapsed()` method to check if a navigation group is collapsed
- Implemented `toggleCollapsedGroup()` method to toggle the collapsed state of a navigation group

### 4. Deprecated Filament Components

Updated deprecated components with modern equivalents:

- Replaced `BadgeColumn` with `TextColumn->badge()`
- Replaced `BooleanColumn` with `TextColumn` using icon and color formatters

## Files Modified

1. `resources/js/filament-init.js`: Enhanced Alpine.js store initialization
2. `vite.config.js`: Updated Vite configuration to include all necessary assets
3. `app/Providers/FilamentServiceProvider.php`: Added Blade render hook for scripts
4. `app/Filament/Resources/LayananPublikResource.php`: Updated deprecated components
5. `app/Filament/Resources/PengaduanResource.php`: Updated deprecated components
6. `app/Filament/Resources/UserResource.php`: Updated deprecated components

## Rebuild Process

Assets were rebuilt using:

```bash
npm run build
```

Caches were cleared using:

```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

## Next Steps

1. Test all admin dashboard functionality to ensure everything works as expected
2. Verify that all resources display correctly with the updated column components
3. Test role-based access to verify permissions are working correctly
4. Complete any remaining frontend features (email notifications, toasts, skeletons, etc.)
